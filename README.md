# ESDC-Tennis-Game
Tennis Game made in VHDL with Quartus II

Here you can find the Blocks used for the Game. Also few waveform files to prove the correct behaviour of the Game.
The main simulations are Game_P1_Demo and Game_P1_Score_Demo. There are also extra waveforms for each block, used to test their correct behaviour.
